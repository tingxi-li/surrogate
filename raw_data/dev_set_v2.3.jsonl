To help inform the content and design of your mural, you need to gather data from a remote database that contains information about the Khalistan struggle and the experiences of Khalistan supporters in sanctuary cities.\n\nYour task is to write a Python function that can connect to the remote database, execute SQL queries, and return the results as a pandas DataFrame. The function should be able to handle any connection errors or SQL exceptions that may arise during the process.\n\nThe function should take the following parameters:\n- `host`: the host address of the remote database\n- `database`: the name of the database\n- `user`: the username for the database\n- `password`: the password for the database\n- `query`: the SQL query to be executed\n\nThe function should return a pandas DataFrame containing the results of the executed query. If any errors occur during the connection or execution of the query, the function should handle them gracefully and provide the user with a meaningful error message.\n\nFor example, the function could execute a query to retrieve information about Khalistan supporters who have fled to sanctuary cities, such as their demographics, the challenges they face, and the support services available to them. This data could then be used to inform the design and content of the mural, ensuring that it accurately reflects the experiences and struggles of the Khalistan community.\n\nYour function should be well-documented, with clear explanations of its purpose, parameters, and return value. Additionally, you should ensure that the function is efficient and can handle large datasets without causing performance issues."}]}

It should then use regular expressions to validate the email addresses, ensuring they are in the correct format. \n\nFor each valid email address, the script should craft a personalized message inviting the customer to share their nostalgic memories and stories related to \"Memories Captured\" or the town of Oakwood. The content of these messages should be imbued with a warm, nostalgic tone, evoking fond recollections of the past and the cherished community that Emma's shop has helped to cultivate.\n\nOnce the personalized messages are ready, the script should utilize the `smtplib` library to securely deliver them to the customers. It should also be equipped to handle any exceptions that may arise, such as invalid email addresses or failed message deliveries, and log these issues for Emma's review.\n\nThe ultimate goal of this initiative is to foster a deeper connection between Emma's business and her customers, while also gathering valuable insights and stories that could be used to enhance the shop's offerings and marketing strategies.
